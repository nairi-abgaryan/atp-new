backyard_first_text: 'The Backyard Nurseries Program (BYN) enables village residents to create income from their existing assets, which usually include parcels of productive agricultural land. ATP provides 1,200-1,500 seedlings to these families who care for and grow them over a two-three year period. ATP staff trains the landowners, supervises the planting, and monitors the site throughout the process. Once trees reach harvesting stage, ATP pays the Backyard Nursery owner for those trees that are ready to be replanted in a community site. These families then begin the nursery cycle again with a new crop of trees.<br />

                                       Armenia Tree Project systematically revitalizes communities within three years, taking into consideration all aspects of the land and its people.'
